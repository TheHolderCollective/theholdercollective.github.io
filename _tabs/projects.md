## Console Minesweeper
I came across a basic version of console minesweeper, and thought it would be a fun exercise to improve it by refactoring the code. I moved all of the code out of Program.cs, and into classes. I then continued the refactoring process by making use of the [Spectre Console](https://spectreconsole.net/) library to improve the user interface. The result turned out to be a rather retro-looking version of minesweeper:
