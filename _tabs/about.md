My educational background includes a mixture of computer science and mathematics at the undergrad level, and actuarial science at the postgrad level. It has been suprisingly good to me as it has allowed me to step through doors which would otherwise have been closed. I've done a bunch of similar yet unrelated things professionally which have all been tied together by the common threads of knowing how to analyse data, problem solve, and code.

Some of my interests include chaos theory, fractals, cricket, rebounding, and cats.

_Please note that due to privacy, mental health, and time theft concerns, I don't participate in an active way on a lot of the more popular social media sites such as Facebook, X, Instagram, or LinkedIn. Therefore this blog along with my github will mostly be it as far as a personal internet presence goes._
