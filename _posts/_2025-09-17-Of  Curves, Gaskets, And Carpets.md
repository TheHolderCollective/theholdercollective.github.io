I'm absolutely convinced that sometimes less is more. I've always been fascinated by fractals and the different means of plotting them. I discovered that Python's Turtle library , as basic as it is, can be used to plot some of the more simple fractals such as Sierpinski gaskets, carpets, and curves.
