A preliminary draft of this post has been sitting in my draft folder for the past several weeks, just screaming at the top its lungs for completion. Life did what it does and "lifed", and so it never got done. I've finally gotten around to finishing it. So here goes...

In the [last post](/posts/Building-Battleship-Part-1/) about the Battleship project, I looked at the layouts and how they were built. I also introduced the `GameDisplay` class. I had promised to delve a bit deeper into the inner workings of the `GameDisplay` class in this post, but I've decided instead to give it its own post due to its comparatively large size and complexity. So there will at some point in time be a third installment documenting my efforts for this Battleship project.

In this installment, I'll be focusing on the changes made to the models in order to achieve the goal of making the game fully playable by a human player. This also includes allowing the player to manually place and position their battleships.
