## Discovering the Book

About 10 days ago, I was reading an article about highschoolers on CBC.ca which mentioned the book Farenheit 451. I'd never heard of the book before so I decided to check it out on Amazon. I discovered it was about a firefighter who burned books for a living, and lived in a world where people interacted more with their television screens than each other. Does this latter part sound familiar?

It made me think of today where almost everyone is constantly glued to their phones in public spaces with hardly any thought about interacting in a present way with their environment. As this thought came to me, I started to wonder how the story would go and what other parallels could be drawn with the fictional world of the book and society today. And so for $1.99, I purchased the Kindle version of the book and started reading it as time permitted. I finally completed it this morning. 

## First Impressions
The book starts off by introducing the main character Montag and his work as firefighter which focused not on saving burning structures, but on destroying books. The fact that books were the target of such extreme measures really disturbed me as a book lover. I couldn't fathom living in a world where books are forbidden and illegal. 


## Last Impressions
I was left creeped out by how dumbed down, vapid, and easily controlled persons in this fictional world of Farenheit 451 had become, and how dangerous the state was to those who challenged or threatened the existing order.
